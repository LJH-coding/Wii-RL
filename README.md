# Wii-RL
AI-Tango's Official Wii Reinforcement Learning Repository

Please watch the video which explains how to use this repository in detail! - (COMING SOON)

This repository contains code to allow Reinforcement Learning agents to to play Wii games. In this repo, we provide an example of:
- A Mario Kart Wii environment, using Luigi Circuit against Hard CPUs on 150cc.
- We provide a Reinforcement Learning algorithm (Beyond The Rainbow), which is setup and ready to interact with the environment.
- This algorithm is able to get first place in approximately one day of training using an RTX4090. This algorithm can still be run on lighter hardware, but may take slightly longer.

Beyond The Rainbow (BTR) algorithm, accepted at ICML 2025 (Poster) - https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03820
