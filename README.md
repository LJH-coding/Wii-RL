AI-Tango's Official Wii Reinforcement Learning Repository

This repository contains code to allow Reinforcement Learning agents to to play Wii games. In this repo, we provide an example of:
- A Mario Kart Wii environment, using Luigi Circuit against Hard CPUs on 150cc.
- We provide a Reinforcement Learning algorithm (Beyond The Rainbow), which is setup and ready to interact with the environment.

  Beyond The Rainbow (BTR) algorithm, accepted atm ICML 2025 (Poster) - https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03820
